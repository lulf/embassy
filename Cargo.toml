# This file is a template for a Cargo workspace for developer convenience.
#
# Since Cargo resolves all features for all crates in the workspace together, 
# it is not possible to have a workspace with all the crates together, since they
# enable incompatible features. For example, nrf crates enable embassy-macros/nrf
# and stm32 crates enable embassy-macros/stm32. embassy-macros doesn't support having
# both of these features on at the same time, because it makes no sense.
#
# Instead, we provide this template so you can enable only the crates you're going to
# work on. This makes eg rust-analyzer check-on-save and autocomplete work, but only 
# in these crates, without any feature conflict.
#
# Copy this file to `Cargo.toml` and uncomment one group of crates below.
#
# `/Cargo.toml` is already in .gitignore, so you don't commit it accidentally.
